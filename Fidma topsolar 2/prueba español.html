                Solar panels are a possibility for you if you want to consume your own, clean energy and save money in
                the long term.<br>
                Solar panels are a long-term investment, so to help you to make the decision, we've put together a guide
                with the various advantages and disadvantages of using this renewable energy for your house, as well as
                an outlook of the future horizon of solar energy.

                    there will be no more greenhouse gas emissions. This is a good reason to opt for the installation of

                    The installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels is an initial costly investment, but in the medium term
                    the energy savings achieved are already very high. Your electricity bill will be cheaper and, in
                    addition, with bi-directional meters you will have the possibility of returning the energy you do
                    not use and "reselling" it. This is an option for anyone who wants to save on energy consumption.

                    One of the most important aspects of solar energy is that it does not generate any type of noise,
                    unlike conventional electrical energy generators. If you do not want to put up with annoying sounds,
                    then this is a possibility to gain in well-being.

                    Photovoltaic energy is compatible with other sources and, in fact, many homes have two installations
                    for conventional energy to work when the other one does not. This is the way to make a gradual
                    transition to solar energy and, above all, to avoid problems.

                Renewable energy has a medium-term horizon and Europe has already set 2030 as the year where energy
                consumption will be 35% renewable. In the automotive and vehicle sector, it is expected that by 2040
                there will no longer be any internal combustion engines and the industry will also be committed to this
                objective.
